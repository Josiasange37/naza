## 🌍 Project Overview

*Air Quality Pulse* is an interactive web application that visualizes real-time air quality and weather data for any location worldwide. Users can select a point on a global map, and the app retrieves weather information using OpenWeatherMap, highlighting temperature, conditions, and environmental context.

The project combines modern web technologies—**Leaflet.js** for map interaction, **Bootstrap** for responsive design, and the **OpenWeatherMap API**—to deliver an intuitive interface for environmental awareness and educational purposes.
